How to store a Pascal's Triangle in an array 

This program is making the Pascal's Triangle stored in an array.A useful application of Pascal’s triangle is the calculation of combinations. 
The formula to find nCr is, 
-----------------------------
--> n! / r! * (n – r)! 
-----------------------------
which is also the formula for a cell of Pascal’s triangle.
By this program we can just get the value of nCr by just feeding n, r, and the program will search the nth row and rth collumn, and display the value accordingly.
